<h2>Census API</h2>
<ul>
<li>What is the Census API?
<ul>
<li>An API that gives access to data from many programs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Programs include:
<ul>
<li>American Community Survey: tables and microdata</li>
<li>Decennial Census</li>
<li>Population Estimates and Projections</li>
<li>And more</li>
</ul></li>

<section id="useful-r-packages" class="slide level2">
<h2>Useful R packages</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>censusapi</strong>
<ul>
<li>Any data program available on Census API</li>
<li>Data is not cleaned</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>tidycensus</strong>
<ul>
<li>ACS tables, ACS microdata, Decennial tables, PEP tables, and ACS migration flow data</li>
<li>Wrappers are written so you don’t have to understand the API details</li>
<li>Data is somewhat cleaned (e.g.&nbsp;-555555555 is changed to missing as it is a missing code)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="census-geographies" class="slide level2">
<h2>Census geographies</h2>
<p>Data may not be available for all geographies. More years of data generally means smaller areas available</p>

The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. Much of the ACS data provided on the Census Bureau's Web site are available separately by age group, race, Hispanic origin, and sex. Summary files, Subject tables, Data profiles, and Comparison profiles are available for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Detailed Tables contain the most detailed cross-tabulations published for areas 65k and more. The data are population counts. There are over 31,000 variables in this dataset.

Comparison profiles are similar to Data profiles but also include comparisons with past-year data. The current year data are compared with each of the last four years of data and include statistical significance testing. There are over 1,000 variables in this dataset.
3 The American Community Survey (ACS) is a US-wide survey designed to provide communities a fresh look at how they are changing. The ACS replaced the decennial census long form in 2010 and thereafter by collecting long form type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. Questionnaires are mailed to a sample of addresses to obtain information about households -- that is, about each person and the housing unit itself. The American Community Survey produces demographic, social, housing and economic estimates in the form of 1 and 5-year estimates based on population thresholds. The strength of the ACS is in estimating population and housing characteristics. The data profiles provide key estimates for each of the topic areas covered by the ACS for the us, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, every congressional district, every metropolitan area, and all counties and places with populations of 65,000 or more. Although the ACS produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, it is the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program that produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the US, states, counties, cities and towns, and estimates of housing units for states and counties. For 2010 and other decennial census years, the Decennial Census provides the official counts of population and housing units.

The ACS PUMS dataset includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status). Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members. Individuals living in Group Quarters, such as nursing facilities or college facilities, are also included on the person file. ACS PUMS data are available at the nation, state, and Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) levels. PUMAs are special non-overlapping areas that partition each state into contiguous geographic units containing roughly 100,000 people each. ACS PUMS files for an individual year, such as 2022, contain data on approximately one percent of the United States population.
5              The Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) for Puerto Rico (PR) contains a sample of responses to the Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS). The PRCS is similar to, but separate from, the American Community Survey (ACS). The PRCS collects data about the population and housing units in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico data is not included in the national PUMS files. It is published as a state equivalent file and has a State FIPS code of "72". The file includes variables for nearly every question on the survey, as well as many new variables that were derived after the fact from multiple survey responses (such as poverty status). Each record in the file represents a single person, or, in the household-level dataset, a single housing unit. In the person-level file, individuals are organized into households, making possible the study of people within the contexts of their families and other household members.

The Puerto Rico PUMS file for an individual year, such as 2022, contain data on approximately one percent of the Puerto Rico population.

The ACS covers a broad range of topics about social, economic, demographic, and housing characteristics of the U.S. population. The 119th Congressional District Data Profiles are available for the nation, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico (at large). Data profiles contain broad social, economic, housing, and demographic information.
